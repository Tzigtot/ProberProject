# ProberProject
The implementation of my prober project.

In this project we will utilize information obtained from our prober drones to provide a tracking service for lecturers.
The goal is that students can locate lecturers for their courses for extra questions/information regarding these coursers.

Currently this is a mock implementation due to the prober drones not providing all required info yet.
